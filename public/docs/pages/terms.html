  <h2>AGREEMENT TO OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE</h2>

  <p>Welcome to Trend My Song (“TMS,” “Platform,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These Legal Terms form a binding agreement between you (whether as an individual artist, a label, or acting on behalf of an entity) and TMS, governing your access to and use of <a href="https://www.trendmysong.com">www.trendmysong.com</a> (the “Site”), as well as any related platforms, tools, and services that reference these Terms (collectively, the “Services”).</p>

  <p>Trend My Song is a digital-first music distribution and marketing agency platform. Our mission is to empower creators by enabling them to distribute their music across streaming platforms, manage their catalogs with transparency, and access promotional opportunities that amplify reach. Unlike traditional rigid plans, our structure is dynamic: pricing is entirely flexible and based on pay-as-you-need purchases completed during checkout. Every creator is assigned their own track count — tailored to the services purchased — ensuring clarity, fairness, and scalability for artists at different stages of their career.</p>

  <p>All financial transactions on the Site are exclusively handled by our appointed Merchant of Record (MoR), who acts as the secure financial intermediary. TMS does not directly store or process payment details. This ensures compliance with international standards of payment handling while allowing us to remain focused on music distribution and marketing.</p>

  <p>By accessing or using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to abide by these Legal Terms. If you do not accept these Terms in their entirety, you are not permitted to use the Services.</p>

  <p>We may, from time to time, revise or update these Legal Terms to reflect evolving practices, technologies, or compliance requirements. Any modifications will be effective immediately upon posting, and continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <p>The Services are intended only for users who are at least 18 years of age. If you are under 18, you are prohibited from using or registering for the Services.</p>

  <h2>1. OUR SERVICES</h2>
  <p>TMS provides artists and rights holders with tools to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Upload and distribute tracks to leading DSPs (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, etc.).</li>
    <li>Access promotion packages and marketing services designed to increase visibility and audience engagement.</li>
    <li>Review royalty reports, campaign statistics, and track-level insights.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each client’s service scope is tied to the number of tracks and promotional credits purchased. We do not provide unlimited uploads; instead, track counts and campaign credits are individualized according to your purchases.</p>
  <p>TMS is designed to function globally, but we do not guarantee compliance with the local laws of every jurisdiction. You are responsible for ensuring your use of the Services is lawful in your region.</p>

  <h2>2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
  <h3>Your Intellectual Property</h3>
  <p>You retain full ownership of your music. By submitting tracks, artwork, or metadata to TMS, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license strictly for the purposes of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delivering your music to DSPs,</li>
    <li>Executing promotional campaigns you purchase,</li>
    <li>Generating and reporting royalties, and</li>
    <li>Displaying your content within TMS dashboards and reports.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This license is operational in scope and does not alter your ownership rights.</p>
  <p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that submitted works are original, properly licensed, and do not infringe on the rights of others.</p>
    <h3>Our Intellectual Property</h3>
  <p>The TMS platform, including its software, databases, branding, design, and associated Content, is proprietary to us and protected by intellectual property laws worldwide. All rights are reserved.</p>
  <p>You may not exploit, replicate, or redistribute our Content or branding without prior written approval.</p>
