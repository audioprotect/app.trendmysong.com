  <h2>TMS Solutions for Record Labels</h2>

  <p>
    TMS provides record labels with a complete toolkit for managing music distribution, royalties, 
    and artist promotion. Whether you need an all-in-one distribution solution or a dedicated 
    marketing agency for your artists, TMS adapts to your label’s needs.
  </p>

  <h2>Distribution for Labels</h2>
  <p>
    TMS offers powerful distribution services designed specifically for labels of any size.  
    Our system supports bulk catalog management, flexible royalty accounting, and advanced 
    dashboards that make label operations simple and efficient.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bulk import of tracks and releases for fast onboarding</li>
    <li>Label accounts with the ability to create sub-accounts for each artist</li>
    <li>Artist dashboards including built-in digital contracts, royalty reports, and payout tracking</li>
    <li>One-way label accounts available if the label prefers to manage royalties and accounting internally without artist sub-accounts</li>
    <li>Automated royalty calculations and artist payouts through the platform</li>
    <li>Access to 250+ DSPs, YouTube Content ID, and social monetization</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Pricing</h3>
  <p>
    Plans start at <strong>$249/month</strong> for unlimited artist profiles, full DSP coverage, Content ID, 
    and up to <strong>500 releases</strong>. Labels keep <strong>100% of their revenue</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the subscription is cancelled, the account remains active, but royalties are adjusted to <strong>80%</strong> 
    instead of 100%.
  </p>

  <h2>Marketing for Labels</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond distribution, TMS acts as a dedicated marketing agency for record labels.  
    We run and manage campaigns that promote your artists’ music on platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and Spotify.  
  </p>

  <h3>How Marketing Works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Labels provide TMS with a promotional budget</li>
    <li>TMS plans and executes influencer campaigns, playlist placements, and social promotions</li>
    <li>Campaigns are fully managed by TMS on behalf of the label</li>
    <li>TMS does <strong>not</strong> take any percentage from the revenue — all royalties remain with the label and its artists</li>
    <li>If a label already has its own distributor, TMS handles only the marketing and promotion, without interfering in distribution or rights management</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why Choose TMS Marketing?</h3>
  <p>
    Labels often struggle to find consistent and reliable marketing partners.  
    With TMS, you get a professional agency that understands music trends, influencer networks, 
    and platform algorithms. Our campaigns are designed to maximize exposure, spark virality, 
    and boost long-term growth for your artists.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether your goal is to grow streams, gain traction on TikTok, or break into Spotify playlists, 
    TMS provides end-to-end campaign management, performance tracking, and transparent reporting.
