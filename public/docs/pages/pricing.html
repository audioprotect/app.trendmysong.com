<h2>What is Flexible Pricing, and Why?</h2>

<p>
  Flexible pricing means you only pay for the exact services you need. 
  Instead of being locked into fixed plans or subscriptions, 
  TMS allows you to build your own plan step by step:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose how many tracks you want to distribute</li>
  <li>Select which platforms you want them delivered to (DSPs, Social Media, YouTube Content ID)</li>
  <li>Add promotion packages to boost your music with influencer campaigns</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This system is designed to save you money, avoid unnecessary costs, and give you full control over your budget. 
  Whether you’re an independent artist with one track or a label managing hundreds, 
  flexible pricing adapts to your needs and ensures you only pay for what truly benefits your music career.
</p>

<h2>One-Time Payment Model</h2>
<p>
  Our flexible pricing does <strong>NOT</strong> include monthly or yearly subscriptions.  
  Every customized plan is a <strong>one-time payment without expiry</strong>.  
  You will always receive <strong>100% of your royalties</strong> because TMS does not operate on a revenue-sharing model.  
  This means artists and labels pay once, monetize 100% forever, and never get locked into subscriptions or recurring payments.
</p>


  <h2>Step 1: Distribution Services</h2>
  <p>Choose how many tracks you want to distribute and select your platforms:</p>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <th>Platform</th>
      <th>What You Get</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong><a href="/docs/#youtube-id">YouTube Content ID</a></strong></td>
      <td>Protect and monetize your music on YouTube</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong><a href="/docs/#social-id">Social Media</a></strong></td>
      <td>Distribute to TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong><a href="/docs/#dsp">Streaming Platforms</a></strong></td>
      <td>Deliver to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Deezer, and 200+ DSPs</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    If you choose YouTube Content ID and/or Social Media, your tracks are automatically protected 
    in the <strong>Content ID Copyright System</strong> (<a href="/docs/#copyright">learn more</a>).
  </p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The term DSPs refers to "Digital Streaming Platforms," such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music</p>


  <h2>Step 2: Promotion Packages</h2>
  <p>Boost your tracks with influencer campaigns on TikTok or Instagram. You can select:</p>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <th>Promotion Reach</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>50K Views</td><td>Entry-level boost for new releases</td></tr>
    <tr><td>100K Views</td><td>Standard visibility boost</td></tr>
    <tr><td>500K Views</td><td>Strong exposure for viral potential</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1M Views</td><td>Major campaign to scale fast</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2M Views</td><td>Massive influencer-driven campaign</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    You can also decide how many tracks (out of your distributed tracks) will be promoted. 
    Example: if you distribute 30 tracks but only want 3 promoted, you can assign promotion 
    packages to those 3 tracks.
  </p>

  <h2>Example</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Total tracks:</strong> 30</li>
    <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> DSPs + Social Media</li>
    <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> 3 tracks selected for promotion</li>
    <li><strong>Promotion reach:</strong> 500K views each</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Result:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>30 tracks distributed to DSPs (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) and Social Media (TikTok, Meta)</li>
    <li>3 tracks promoted</li>
    <li>Each promoted track receives 500K guaranteed views</li>
    <li>Total promotion = 1.5M views</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Promotion Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Promotion begins <strong>after distribution is complete</strong></li>
    <li>Our marketing team will contact you to confirm which tracks to promote</li>
    <li>You can choose TikTok or Instagram as your main promotion channel</li>
    <li>You may also share preferences (e.g. dance trends, edits, lifestyle influencers)</li>
    <li>Once campaigns run, TMS will provide direct links to influencer videos featuring your music</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Distribution and promotion are bundled into your customized plan</li>
    <li>All influencer campaigns are managed by TMS Marketing Agency</li>
    <li>You always receive video links and reports regarding influencer campaigns</li>
  </ul>
