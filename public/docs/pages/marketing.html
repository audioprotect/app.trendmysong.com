  <h2>TMS Marketing Agency</h2>

  <p>
    TMS specializes in music marketing through influencer seeding, UGC funnels, 
    and paid boosts that convert.  
    With our extensive network of TikTok and Instagram influencers, 
    we make songs trend worldwide by placing them into viral content.
  </p>

  <h2>Influencer Network</h2>
  <p>
    We are partnered and contracted with influencers across TikTok and Instagram 
    who collectively reach <strong>hundreds of millions of followers</strong>.  
    These influencers are carefully selected to promote our clients’ songs, 
    sparking trends where they start — in short-form content.

  </ul>

  <h2>Viral Growth - Strategy</h2>
  <p>
    Songs go viral on social media when they are repeatedly used by top creators.  
    When a major influencer with millions of followers uses your track in a dance, edit, or trend, 
    their audience often copies and remixes the idea, creating a <strong>UGC snowball effect</strong>.  
    This leads to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Massive exposure and organic shares</li>
    <li>Increased streams on Spotify, Apple Music, and other DSPs</li>
    <li>Growth in fanbase and recognition worldwide</li>
    <li>Higher chances of being picked up by editorial and algorithmic playlists</li>
  </ul>
