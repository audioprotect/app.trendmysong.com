   <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    TMS delivers your music to <strong>Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Deezer, Amazon Music, 
    and 150+ other DSPs (Digital Streaming Platforms)</strong>.  
    To ensure a smooth release, it’s important to follow industry standards for metadata, artwork, 
    and audio quality. This guide provides an overview of best practices, common mistakes to avoid, 
    and key requirements when preparing your music for distribution.
  </p>

  <h2>What is DSP Distribution?</h2>
  <p>
    DSP distribution means delivering your music to global streaming platforms and digital stores 
    so that listeners worldwide can access, stream, and purchase your songs.  
    Clean and accurate metadata is critical — it ensures your music is searchable, correctly credited, 
    and eligible for monetization and playlists.
  </p>

  <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide <strong>final mastered versions</strong> only — no demos, drafts, or rough mixes.</li>
    <li>Artwork must be <strong>3000x3000 pixels</strong>, JPG/PNG, without logos, URLs, or social handles.</li>
    <li>Fill in all metadata fields correctly (artist name, title, songwriter etc...).</li>
    <li>Double-check <strong>capitalization, spelling, and formatting</strong> — consistency matters across DSPs.</li>
    <li>Ensure you own or control all rights to the audio and artwork.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Do’s</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use your <strong>official artist name</strong> consistently across all releases.</li>
    <li>Credit all contributors properly (producers, featured artists, composers, etc.).</li>
    <li>Submit metadata exactly as you want it displayed on DSPs (avoid abbreviations unless official).</li>
    <li>Set a realistic release date and allow <strong>2–3 weeks of lead time</strong> for playlist pitching.</li>
    <li>Check your audio for silence at the beginning or end before uploading.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Don’ts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t use ALL CAPS or random capitalization unless it is part of the official title.</li>
    <li>Don’t include “featuring” or “prod. by” in the track title — use metadata fields instead.</li>
    <li>Don’t upload copyrighted samples, beats, or content you don’t fully own or license.</li>
    <li>Don’t add social media handles, links, emails, or promotional text in track titles or artwork.</li>
    <li>Don’t submit duplicate or nearly identical versions of the same track.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Metadata Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Metadata is how DSPs identify, credit, and distribute your music.  
    Incorrect metadata can lead to rejected releases, misdirected royalties, or 
    songs being grouped under the wrong artist profile. Always ensure accuracy.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Following these guidelines ensures your music is distributed smoothly, 
    accepted by DSPs without delays, and presented professionally to your audience.  
    TMS handles the delivery, but the quality of your metadata and assets is 
    what ensures success across platforms.
