  <h2>General</h2>

  <h3>What is TMS (Trend My Song)?</h3>
  <p>
    TMS is an all-in-one platform designed to help music creators with distribution,
    marketing, monetization, and copyright protection. It combines these services
    into a single solution.
  </p>

  <h3>What’s the difference between TMS &amp; DistroKid or TuneCore?</h3>
  <p>
    DistroKid and TuneCore mainly handle music distribution. TMS combines distribution
    with TikTok influencer promotion, Spotify playlist placements, Content ID protection,
    Sync Monetization (earn from YouTube without YPP), AI music acceptance, and 100% royalties
    with a one-time payment.
  </p>

  <h3>Do I need any other platforms besides TMS?</h3>
  <p>
    No. TMS provides everything in one platform — no need for separate distributors,
    promoters, or copyright services.
  </p>

  <h3>Is AI-generated music accepted?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. TMS accepts AI-generated music from platforms like Udio, Suno, and others.
  </p>

  <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
  <p>
    TMS uses a one-time payment model, giving you full access to all services without
    recurring fees, while letting you keep all royalties.
  </p>

  <h3>How does TMS pay artists?</h3>
  <p>
    Artists keep 100% of their royalties. Earnings from streaming, Content ID,
    YouTube Sync Monetization, and influencer campaigns are all paid directly to the artist.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Copyright Protection</h2>

  <h3>What is YouTube Content ID (C-ID)?</h3>
  <p>
    C-ID detects your music in other videos. You can monetize, block, or track usage —
    ensuring protection and revenue generation.
  </p>

  <h3>Does TMS protect my music on other social media platforms?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. TMS provides Social Media C-ID for platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and more.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I register my music for Content ID?</h3>
  <p>
    Simply upload your track to TMS; it handles Content ID registration and copyright protection automatically.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I monetize AI-generated music with Content ID?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, as long as it qualifies for Content ID and monetization.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I earn from my Content ID claims?</h3>
  <p>
    When your music is used in videos, C-ID collects revenue from ads, views, or streams and pays it directly to you.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I remove or place a claim on a video, or whitelist my own channel?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. You have full control to block, monetize, track, or remove claims. You can also whitelist your
    channel to keep revenue via YPP instead of TMS.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Promotion</h2>

  <h3>How does TMS make my song go viral on TikTok?</h3>
  <p>
    TMS connects your song with verified TikTok influencers who use your track in dances, edits,
    and trends — sparking a snowball effect.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I promote my music on Spotify?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. TMS works with verified playlist curators to feature your tracks, boosting streams,
    algorithmic recommendations, and visibility.
  </p>

  <h3>Do I get paid from promotion campaigns? (e.g., TikTok Views)</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Every promotion video and Shorts using your song generates royalties via Content ID.
    Revenue is collected and paid directly, withdrawable from the payout portal.
  </p>

  <h3>How long does a promotion campaign last?</h3>
  <p>
    On TikTok/Instagram: your song remains in influencer videos permanently.
    <br />
    On Spotify: campaigns are flexible (daily, weekly, or custom).
  </p>

  <h3>Can I track the performance of promoted tracks?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Your dashboard shows all results (Spotify streams, TikTok usage) plus influencer video links.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I set how many views I want on TikTok influencer videos?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. You can choose the number of videos and minimum views per video.
    Example: 5 influencer videos (5M+ followers) = 2M views/video or 10M total views.
  </p>

  <h3>Who chooses the influencers that promote my song?</h3>
  <p>
    TMS selects influencers that fit your song’s vibe and genre, handling promotion, edits,
    and dances, and provides links once published.
