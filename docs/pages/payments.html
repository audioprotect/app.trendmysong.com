  <h2>Accepted Payment Methods</h2>
  
  <p>
    TMS provides flexible and secure payment options for all clients worldwide. 
    Whether you prefer traditional payment methods or digital assets, 
    we ensure that your checkout process is fast, transparent, and reliable.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Credit / Debit Cards</strong> – We accept major cards including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and others.</li>
    <li><strong>PayPal</strong> – Pay quickly and securely using your PayPal account.</li>
    <li><strong>Stablecoins (USDT, USDC)</strong> – For clients who prefer crypto payments, stablecoins are supported.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Secure Processing</h2>
  <p>
    TMS does not directly process, store, or handle your credit card or PayPal details. 
    Instead, all transactions are securely processed by a <strong>U.S.-Certified Merchant of Record (MoR)</strong>, 
    which also ensures compliance with international taxes and VAT requirements.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>All <strong>credit card payments</strong> are securely processed through <strong>Stripe</strong>.</li>
    <li>All <strong>PayPal transactions</strong> are handled directly by PayPal’s system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Crypto Payments</h2>
  <p>
    For stablecoin payments (USDT, USDC), invoices are generated during checkout. 
    After sending the payment, you must provide the <strong>Transaction Hash (TXID)</strong> 
    as proof of payment for verification. Once confirmed on the blockchain, 
    your order will be marked as complete and your services will be activated.
  </p>

  <h2>Important Notes</h2>
    <p>
    All payments made on the TMS platform are strictly <strong>one-time payments</strong>. 
    There are <strong>no recurring fees</strong>, subscriptions, or hidden charges. 
    You pay once for your selected service, and you keep 100% of your royalties forever.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>TMS never stores sensitive payment data such as card numbers or PayPal credentials.</li>
    <li>International taxes (including VAT) are automatically handled by our MoR during checkout.</li>
    <li>Crypto payments must be confirmed on the blockchain before services are delivered.</li>
    <li>Invoices and payment confirmations will always be available in your account dashboard after checkout.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Our goal is to make payments simple, secure, and accessible to creators worldwide — 
    giving you peace of mind while focusing on your music and promotions.
