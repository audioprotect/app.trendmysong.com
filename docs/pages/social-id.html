    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    TMS extends Content ID protection beyond YouTube by covering major social media platforms 
    including <strong>TikTok</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong>, and <strong>Facebook</strong> 
    through Meta’s Rights Manager. This ensures your music is identified, protected, and monetized 
    across user-generated content worldwide.
  </p>

  <h2>What is Social Media Content ID?</h2>
  <p>
    Social Media Content ID works similarly to YouTube Content ID.  
    It scans TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook for your registered music and applies rights management 
    policies such as monetization, blocking, or tracking.  
    This allows you to capture revenue whenever your music is used in short-form videos, reels, 
    and posts on these platforms.
  </p>

  <h2>Guidelines & Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must fully own or control all rights to the audio before submission</li>
    <li>Tracks already registered by another distributor cannot be re-registered</li>
    <li>Metadata and audio quality must meet platform requirements</li>
    <li>Prohibited content (public domain, royalty-free libraries, generic effects) is not accepted</li>
    <li>AI-generated tracks are eligible only if fully original and not copied from existing works</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Prohibited Content Types</h2>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
    <tr><th>Not Eligible for Social Media Content ID</th></tr>
    <tr><td>White noise and ambient loops</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sleep, meditation, and relaxation tracks</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Royalty-free or stock music</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Generic sound effects or short samples</td></tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Monetization on TikTok</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your music is scanned and identified in TikTok videos</li>
    <li>Revenue is generated based on the usage of your track in user videos</li>
    <li>Payouts are calculated by TikTok’s rights management system and delivered through TMS</li>
    <li>You benefit from virality when influencers use your track in dances or edits</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Monetization on Meta Platforms (Instagram & Facebook)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Meta’s Rights Manager identifies your music in reels, stories, and posts</li>
    <li>Revenue is redirected to your account when ads are shown on videos containing your music</li>
    <li>You can choose to monetize, block, or allow free use of your music</li>
    <li>Analytics are available to track usage across Meta platforms</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Control Options</h2>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <th>Option</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Monetize</td>
      <td>Earn revenue from ads placed on videos using your music</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Block</td>
      <td>Prevent your music from being used in videos on TikTok or Meta</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Track</td>
      <td>Allow videos to stay live while monitoring usage without monetization</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
