  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    YouTube Content ID (C-ID) is one of the most powerful tools for protecting and monetizing music.  
    TMS helps register and manage your tracks in Content ID, ensuring you collect revenue when your music 
    is used across YouTube — both in long-form videos and Shorts.
  </p>

  <h2>What is YouTube Content ID?</h2>
  <p>
    Content ID is YouTube’s automated system that scans videos for copyrighted material.  
    If your track is registered, YouTube can automatically identify when it’s used in a video 
    and apply the policy you set: monetize, block, or track usage.  
    This ensures that you never miss out on royalties and that your content is protected worldwide.
  </p>

  <h2>Guidelines & Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must fully own or control the rights to the track (audio, composition, and artwork)</li>
    <li>Tracks already registered in Content ID by another distributor cannot be re-registered</li>
    <li>Metadata must be accurate and consistent to avoid conflicts</li>
    <li>Do not attempt to register public domain, royalty-free, or stock music</li>
    <li>Only original content is accepted — covers and remixes may be rejected unless fully licensed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Prohibited Track Types</h2>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <th>Not Eligible for Content ID</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>White noise, ambient noise, and environmental recordings</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sleep music and meditation tracks</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Relaxation, yoga, or binaural beats</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Generic sound effects or short audio loops</td></tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Monetization of Long-Form Videos</h2>
  <p>
    When your track is used in a long-form YouTube video (standard upload), Content ID redirects 
    the ad revenue from that video to your account. This applies even if the uploader is monetized 
    through the YouTube Partner Program (YPP).
  </p>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <th>Policy Option</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Monetize</td>
      <td>Earn ad revenue from views generated by your music</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Block</td>
      <td>Prevent the video from being available in selected regions or worldwide</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Track</td>
      <td>Allow the video to stay live while monitoring usage without monetization</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>YouTube Shorts & Content ID</h2>
  <p>
    Shorts monetization works differently from long-form videos. When your music is used in a Short:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Revenue is placed into the YouTube Shorts revenue pool</li>
    <li>The pool is shared between creators and rights holders</li>
    <li>You receive revenue even if the creator using your music is not monetized</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Channel Whitelist & Claim Removal</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Channel Whitelist</strong> – Add your own or partner channels to avoid claims and keep monetization through YPP</li>
    <li><strong>Claim Removal</strong> – Request the removal of claims on specific videos you wish to allow for free use while keeping monetization active through YPP, without whitelisting the entire channel.</li>
    <li><strong>Policy Adjustments</strong> – Switch between monetize, block, or track for specific cases</li>
  </ul>
