  <h2>What is TMS White Label?</h2>
  <p>
    For businesses or individuals who would like to start their own 
    music distribution platform or marketing agency — we’ve got your back!  
    With TMS White Label, you get a complete platform under your own brand, 
    while we handle all the complicated technical and backend operations.
</p>
<p>
    TMS offers a White Label Service where we provide you with 
    a ready-to-run platform, dashboards, systems, and services, all branded 
    under your name. You remain in control as the administrator of your platform, 
    while we take care of all the backend services, technical infrastructure, 
    and day-to-day operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    This allows you to focus on growing your business, attracting clients, 
    and building your brand without worrying about the complexity of music 
    distribution technology or copyright management.
