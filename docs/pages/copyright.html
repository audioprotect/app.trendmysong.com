  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Copyright protection ensures that your music is safe from unauthorized use across digital platforms.  
    TMS registers your tracks in major Content ID and audio fingerprint databases, giving you worldwide protection 
    and monetization opportunities.
  </p>

  <h2>What is Content ID?</h2>
  <p>
    Content ID is a technology that identifies copyrighted audio across online platforms by comparing uploaded content 
    to a global database of registered works. Once your track is registered, it is automatically detected when used 
    in videos, streams, or posts — ensuring you remain in control.
  </p>

  <h2>Platforms Covered</h2>
  <p>
    TMS provides copyright protection across multiple platforms:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>YouTube Content ID</strong> – Protect and monetize your music across long-form videos and Shorts</li>
    <li><strong>TikTok Rights Management</strong> – Detect and monetize your music in short-form viral content</li>
    <li><strong>Meta Rights Manager</strong> – Identify and monetize your music on Instagram and Facebook</li>
    <li><strong>Streaming DSPs</strong> – Ensure your metadata is accurate across Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, Amazon Music, and 150+ DSPs</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Fingerprint Databases</strong> – Register with global systems for additional protection</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fingerprint Databases</h2>
  <p>
    In addition to platform-specific Content ID, TMS uses industry-leading audio fingerprinting services to ensure 
    worldwide protection. These databases detect your music across UGC platforms, radio, apps, and third-party services:
